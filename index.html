<div class="con">
        <ol>
                <li>CSS stand for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
                <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
                <li> <span class="it">Css is not neccesary </span> <span class="bg"> CSS saves a lot of work </span> <span>It can control the multiple web pages all at once</span></li>
                <li id="fourth">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
        </ol> </div>
<h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>

<div class="con2"><li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements!</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span class="bg"> in this tutorialwe will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself. </li>

<div class="pre">  When comparing CSS class ve ID, the diference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID,on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by javascript. 
<br>
<br>
In CSS, selectord are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element. 
<br>
<br>
There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID, both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied. </div>
